Theoretical Challange
------------------------------
Solution:

My approach to takle the problem statement-

1. I will read the input bia any of the input tha avaiable in java (eg. Scanner)

2. Take all the input in key value pair with key as String and value as String

3. Now I will check if the value is an Integer or not. If the value is an Integer then I will print this and if it is formula then calculate the value according to the formula and print.

4. To calculate the value having formula I will check for ArethmaticException as there can be a formula something like (10/0) which will cause arethmatic exception. Also, I will check for NullPointerException and it will take care of any Null Pointers.

5. I will write comment at every step of my code so that anyone can understand and break down my code to understand.
